# What's this? Another repo for me to start?

> That's right! You saw it here first!

This is where I'm going to be doing a whole lot of practice and repetition with data analysis. I'm planning to make up about 4 hours of data analysis every week on top of uni and work so that I can say outright that I am practicing data processing. If needs be, I will also be working on any data that is given to me to work through for any reason so if you know anyone that wants some data cleaned and/or processed, send it my way and I'll have a crack at it!

## FAQs

> (nobody is actually asking me any questions)

- Are you going to actually keep on top of this?
  - ___Yes___, or at least I hope I will. I'm carving out blocks of about 1 or 2 hours most days to try and get this done and I'd like to have something to show for it, all consolidated in one place, almost like a portfolio.

- What do you hope to gain from this?
  - ___Experience___. There is nothing more frustrating than feeling like I could get a job or do some work for just about anyone and saying 'I can do this!' only to see that every time I try to process some data, I forget how to do it. I'm going to get better no matter what.

- What would anyone else gain from you doing this?
  - Hopefully a bit of ___insight___ into what I can do, and how I can commit (excuse the git pun) myself to doing so on top of other things. I'd love to produce nice-looking graphs, as well as gain some useful information about just about anything.

- What's made you want to do this?
  - ___Many things___. Not only do I sincerely hate the struggle of finding a job in a market that's highly saturated, I want to stand out a little. I want to broadcast what I can do and hopefully make something worth everyone's time.
  - ___Data is beautiful___. Well, no, _information_ is beautiful, but so is the process of turning a collection of seemingly unrelated data points into something that makes real, concrete sense.
