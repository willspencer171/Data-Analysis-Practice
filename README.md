# What's this? Another repo for me to start?

> That's right! You saw it here first!

This is where I'm going to be doing a whole lot of practice and repetition with data analysis. I'm planning to make up about 4 hours of data analysis every week on top of uni and work so that I can say outright that I am practicing data processing. If needs be, I will also be working on any data that is given to me to work through for any reason so if you know anyone that wants some data cleaned and/or processed, send it my way and I'll have a crack at it!

## Good Sources of Bad Data

At the moment (14/5) I'm looking at Kaggle.com for datasets that I can download and clean. However, a lot of the datasets that are available there are relatively well-cleaned and managed. I found a Pokémon dataset that someone created in their first attempts at web scraping. Was fun to look through, but all I did was verify that it was 'clean'. I need more data that looks awful. Also, I need to really outline what it means for data to be 'clean'.

Clean data is:

- Correct
- Uncorrupted
- Complete
- Formatted
- Singular (no duplicates)

So, in the Pokémon dataset, I'd be looking to make sure that the values are correct (which, to my knowledge, they were - I even checked that all null-value gender ratios were in fact genderless Pokémon). There was no corruption in the dataset. All null values were expectedly null, and there were 1025 entries (for 1025 Pokémon by generation 9).

### What now?

The data is already clean. So I think I'm going to come back to actually processing this data another time. I can look at which types have highest base stats or egg groups or other parameters. Either way, there aren't any aggregate groups to create (other than maybe a M:F gender ratio) so I also don't need to do any data transformation (except when I come to analyse later on).

I need data with more wrong with it.

Here are some places that Reddit suggested I go to for it:

- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/)
  - This seems like a good place to find a lot of datasets
- [Data is Plural Mail List](https://www.data-is-plural.com)
  - Will be signing up for this and maybe using this as my go-to for finding a new dataset each week
- [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/)
  - A huge web scraping database that's kept petabytes of data since 2008

I also found a comment on a Reddit post that said the best way to find datasets and practice data cleaning is to find a project and work on the data for that project. Find something that interests you, get the data yourself, and clean it yourself. Problem is, when I think about what projects I'd like to do myself, I forget that there's a world of data outside of just Pokémon, just cos I know it well. It also makes sense to pick a project, because this way you know what questions you might want to answer. I've been struggling to think of questions that need answers. So maybe I should think about it from a question-driven point of view.

### Enter, speaking to the University

Since I am a university student nonlocally, it might be a good idea to speak to someone at my uni about what data they might be able to offer me. There are a fair number of different faculties at UoY that would all have data associated with them - the biology department is no stranger to data analysis. I could also speak to someone at the local university since there are different departments that will also need data analysed. Perhaps this way I could also get my name on some published work?

## FAQs

> (nobody is actually asking me any questions)

- Are you going to actually keep on top of this?
  - ___Yes___, or at least I hope I will. I'm carving out blocks of about 1 or 2 hours most days to try and get this done and I'd like to have something to show for it, all consolidated in one place, almost like a portfolio.

- What do you hope to gain from this?
  - ___Experience___. There is nothing more frustrating than feeling like I could get a job or do some work for just about anyone and saying 'I can do this!' only to see that every time I try to process some data, I forget how to do it. I'm going to get better no matter what.

- What would anyone else gain from you doing this?
  - Hopefully a bit of ___insight___ into what I can do, and how I can commit (excuse the git pun) myself to doing so on top of other things. I'd love to produce nice-looking graphs, as well as gain some useful information about just about anything.

- What's made you want to do this?
  - ___Many things___. Not only do I sincerely hate the struggle of finding a job in a market that's highly saturated, I want to stand out a little. I want to broadcast what I can do and hopefully make something worth everyone's time.
  - ___Data is beautiful___. Well, no, _information_ is beautiful, but so is the process of turning a collection of seemingly unrelated data points into something that makes real, concrete sense.
